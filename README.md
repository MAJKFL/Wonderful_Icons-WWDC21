# Wonderful Icons - WWDC21
A swift playgorund created by Jakub Florek for WWDC21 Swift Student Challange

## About
It's a quick and simple guide to designing „wonderful icons”. It's hard to create something unique, meaningful, universal and beautiful at the same time. That’s why I made the playground to help people understand how to design icons with less effort and more fun!

## How to run

Playround is optimized for running on **iPad Swift playgrounds app 3.4.1**.
You should first download .playgroundBook file and open it on your iPad.
After that you should be able to run it inside app!

## Used technologies

1. SwiftUI - For whole interface
2. Combine - Timer was used in SwiftUI animations
3. AVFoundation - Camera shutter audio feedback
4. UIKit - Snapshoting view for download. Thanks to SwiftUI integration by UIHostingController
